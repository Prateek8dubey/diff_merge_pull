this is answer to question number three where we need to give differences 
between git pull and git merge .
so the basic and most important difference between the git pull and git merge is that 
git merge -git merge actully merge the changes with our local repo that we have fetched 
from the remote repo 
git pull  -git pull actully performs both the task of fetching the content 
from teh remote repo and merging them with the the local repo in a single command
